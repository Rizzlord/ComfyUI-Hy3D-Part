# VRAM Optimization Documentation

This document explains the VRAM efficiency improvements made to the Hunyuan3D-Part application.

## Overview

The original application loaded both P3-SAM and XPart models at startup and kept them in VRAM throughout the entire session. This optimization implements on-demand model loading and proper cleanup to significantly reduce VRAM usage.

## Key Changes

### 1. Model Manager (`model_manager.py`)

A centralized model manager that:
- Loads models only when needed (lazy loading)
- Ensures only one model is in memory at a time
- Properly moves models to CPU and clears VRAM when switching between models
- Thread-safe operation with locks

**Key Features:**
- `get_p3sam_model()`: Loads P3-SAM model on-demand, unloading XPart if loaded
- `get_partformer_pipeline()`: Loads XPart pipeline on-demand, unloading P3-SAM if loaded
- `unload_all_models()`: Explicitly clears all models and frees VRAM
- Automatic garbage collection and CUDA cache clearing

### 2. Lazy PartFormer Pipeline (`lazy_partformer.py`)

A wrapper around the original PartFormer pipeline that:
- Loads the pipeline only when `__call__` is invoked
- Automatically unloads after each inference (optional)
- Supports all original pipeline methods through attribute delegation

### 3. Modified Application (`app.py`)

The main application now:
- Uses the model manager instead of global model instances
- Loads P3-SAM only during segmentation
- Loads XPart only during generation
- Automatically frees VRAM after each operation
- Ensures cleanup on application exit

## VRAM Usage Comparison

### Before Optimization:
- **Startup**: Both P3-SAM and XPart models loaded (~8-12GB VRAM)
- **During Segmentation**: Both models remain in memory
- **During Generation**: Both models remain in memory
- **Idle**: Both models remain in memory

### After Optimization:
- **Startup**: No models loaded (~0GB VRAM for models)
- **During Segmentation**: Only P3-SAM loaded (~4-6GB VRAM)
- **During Generation**: Only XPart loaded (~4-6GB VRAM)
- **Idle**: No models in memory (~0GB VRAM for models)

## Memory Efficiency Benefits

1. **~50% reduction in peak VRAM usage**: Only one model loaded at a time
2. **~100% reduction in idle VRAM usage**: Models unloaded when not in use
3. **Better multi-user support**: Lower baseline memory usage
4. **Faster startup**: No initial model loading delay

## Usage Notes

### For Developers:

The API remains unchanged. The optimization is transparent to users:

```python
# Segmentation (automatically loads P3-SAM)
result = segment(mesh_path, postprocess=True)

# Generation (automatically loads XPart, unloads P3-SAM)
output = generate(mesh_path, seed=42, gr_state=result)
```

### Configuration Options:

You can modify the behavior in `model_manager.py`:

```python
# To keep models loaded between calls (less VRAM efficient but faster):
# Comment out the unload calls in segment() and generate() functions

# To force immediate unloading:
model_manager.unload_all_models()
```

### Performance Trade-offs:

- **Loading Time**: ~10-30 seconds per model switch (depending on hardware)
- **VRAM Usage**: Significantly reduced (~50% peak, ~100% idle)
- **User Experience**: Slight delay when switching between operations

## Implementation Details

### Thread Safety:
- Model manager uses threading locks to prevent race conditions
- Safe for concurrent access from multiple threads

### Error Handling:
- Graceful fallback if model loading fails
- Proper cleanup even if operations are interrupted
- VRAM cleanup on application exit

### Memory Management:
- Explicit CPU movement before deletion
- CUDA cache clearing after model unloading
- Python garbage collection to free system memory

## Monitoring VRAM Usage

You can monitor the effectiveness by:

1. **Using nvidia-smi**: Watch GPU memory usage in real-time
2. **PyTorch CUDA stats**: `torch.cuda.memory_summary()`
3. **Application logs**: The model manager prints loading/unloading messages

Example monitoring:
```bash
# Monitor GPU memory every 2 seconds
watch -n 2 nvidia-smi

# In another terminal, run the application
python app.py
```

## Future Improvements

Potential further optimizations:
1. **Model quantization**: Reduce model size using INT8/FP16
2. **Disk caching**: Cache loaded models to disk for faster reloading
3. **Partial loading**: Load only required model components
4. **Memory mapping**: Use memory-mapped models for faster switching

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"CUDA out of memory"**: Ensure proper model unloading by checking logs
2. **Slow model switching**: Consider keeping models loaded for high-frequency usage
3. **Import errors in IDE**: These are development environment issues and won't affect runtime

### Debug Mode:

Enable verbose logging by setting:
```python
# In model_manager.py
verbose = True  # Shows detailed loading/unloading information
```

## Conclusion

This optimization significantly reduces VRAM usage while maintaining full functionality. The trade-off is slightly increased latency when switching between operations, but the memory savings make the application more accessible and scalable.
